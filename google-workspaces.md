# Google Workspaces for Non-Profits
Google offers [Workspace for Non-Profits](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/), which is a free version of it's business product.  This product includes accounts for users, email, drive storage, mailing lists, chat, and more.

## Sign Up (Non-Profit)
Before you can sign up for Google Workspace for Non-Profits, you will need to have a personal Google account to make the request.

Wait until [TechSoup](https://www.techsoup.org) shows that your [account status](https://www.techsoup.org/my-account) is "Qualified.".  You will need your validation token to proceed.

If you do not want to wait, you can still proceed with the instructions in the next section: Sign Up (Business).  If you do that, don't forget to come back and upgrade to a Google Workspace for Non-Profits account before your free trial ends.

1. Click the Get Started button on the [Google for Non-Profits](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/) page.
2. You will need to be logged in as your own personal account (@gmail.com).  If you have a Google account through another organization, verify you are not logged in to that account.
3. Click Next through the screens, reading and answering the questions.
4. When prompted, indicate YES that you do have a TechSoup account.
5. Continue through the steps until you are finished.

## Sign Up (Business)
Follow these instructions if you don't have access to your [tax documents](./tax-documents.md), or there is a problem with your [Tech Soup](./techsoup.md) validation.  After your free trial, you will be charged $12/mo/user if you follow these instructions, but you can upgrade to [Workspace for Non-Profits](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/) later, once you get your paper work in order.

3. If your PTA has a domain name, enter it when prompted.

7. Enter bank or credit card information when prompted.

## Login to Admin Panel for the First Time
You will reach this point by completing the instructions in one of the above "Sign Up" sections.

3. If there are any additional users to create, do that now by clicking the CREATE button.
4. Read the information about email accounts, and click CONTINUE.
5. For each user you are adding, click ADD ANOTHER USER.  Enter their name, email address, and any aliases you wish to assign.  (Aliases map to a single user.  If you want to create an email list that goes to multiple users instead, that can be created later in the Groups section of the admin panel.)
6. Click CONTINUE when you are done entering users, and you will be taken to a page where you can email those users their new login information.
7. For each user, click the mail icon.  Enter their personal email address and click SEND.  When you are done, click CONTINUE.
8. On the final step, click ACTIVATE to enable email services on your account.
9. Read the messages, and click I'M READY TO ACTIVATE GMAIL.
