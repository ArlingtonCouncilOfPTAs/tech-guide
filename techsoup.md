# TechSoup
[TechSoup](https://www.techsoup.org) is a service which validates Non-Profit status and connects organizations with technology services at a reduced cost.  This is a prerequisite to signing up for [Google Workspaces for Non-Profits](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/).

# Sign Up
1. Create a personal account at Tech Soup using your own name and email address.
2. Go to the [My Account](https://www.techsoup.org/my-account) page.
3. Click Add an Organization.
4. Select Nonprofit with 501(c)(3) status and enter your [EIN](./tax-documents.md).
5. Enter your organization's information (remember: the official name of your organization is "PTA Texas Congress", but the budget, address, and phone number information is unique to your PTA)

Once your organization has been created, your status will be "Pending Qualification."  You can't request technology products until your verification is complete.  Watch your email, in case further information (like the [IRS Determination Letter](./tax-documents.md)) is needed.

You will also be given an "Association Code."  You can give this code to other trusted members of the PTA so that they can join your organization as administrators, just like you.  The current PTA President and Treasurer should be invited at a minimum.  Depending on the structure of your PTA, it might be appropriate to invite other people as well (such as whoever is managing your technology).
