## Texas PTA Online Training

## Board Member Reporting
Board members can self-report online through the [Texas PTA website](https://www.txpta.org/register-as-a-board-member).  This will allow Texas PTA to keep track of who the current board members are, which will be important if you ever have to reach out to the state PTA for assistance.

## JoinPTA.org
