# Join a LastPass Family
This guide is for PTA members who are already [logged in to LastPass](./lastpass-signup.md) and have been invited to join a LastPass Family subscription.  This gives the member a LastPass Premium account, and the ability to recieve shared folders containing groups of passwords.  This also allows a member to [setup emergency access](./lastpass-protect.md) on their account with another trusted person to protect the contents of their vault in case they lose their password (or worse).
