# Securing Permission to Make Changes
_This document is for the well-meaning and highly motivated tech person who will find themselves considering (and possibly implementing) the advice found in this guide._

Before embarking on the noble quest to "fix all the things," it's important to verify several things.

1. The things actually need fixing
2. The powers that be WANT them to be fixed
3. You are the person who is supposed to fix them

Start by getting the lay of the land.  Introduce yourself to the PTA board, and find out how they are doing things today.  Is there someone already looking into these issues?  Are they happy with the way things are?  

_Despite what your finely-tuned IT spidey-senses are telling you, it's actually OK for a board to manage their documents - and even passwords - entirely using paper binders and Microsoft Excel.  Sometimes, the low-tech tools are still the right tools for the job._

If you identify any gaps, find out if now is the right time to invest time and energy into this area.  If so, lay out your proposal for how you might make improvements.  Try not to tackle unrelated changes in parallel.  Grouping related changes together, or making one change at a time allows the board time to adjust.  Changing too much too fast will cause distress and erode the trust they have placed in you.

Once the board agrees to a plan, verify that they want _you_ to be the one to execute the changes.  It is always preferable to have a team, even a small one, in place while implementing new tools.  It spreads the knowledge around, and allows the greatest opportunity to detect mistakes.

Always consider the potential value of a change as weighed against its operational cost.  You have to consider not just the effort of setting the process up now, but how it will be maintained from year to year (and after you have left).  If the solution were to be neglected, could it cause harm to the organization?  Your job is to make the board more effective, not to make them closely resemble a Fortune 500 company.

Remember: the simplest solution that meets the essential need is likely the best one.
