# Protecting Your Vault
As noted during the [signup](./lastpass-signup.md) process, losing your password requires resetting your account to restore access, and any passwords created by you will be lost.  As a protection against that (or in case something worse happens), you can grant another user the ability to enter your vault in case of emergency.

This feature is not available in the free version of LastPass.  Therefore, it is reccomended that critical PTA passwords be created by users with paid accounts, and that those accounts follow this process.

## Open LastPass
Open the LastPass app on your device and click on the Security button at the bottom of the screen.

## Invite a Trusted User
Enter the email address of a LastPass user that you trust.  You can also select the waiting period for allowing them access to your account.  If you do not respond to their access request within this timeframe, they will be able to access the passwords in your account.

## Request Sent
The request has been sent.  The user you sent the invitation to will need to follow a similar process to go to Emergency Access on their device and accept the invitation from the "People Who Trust Me" tab.
