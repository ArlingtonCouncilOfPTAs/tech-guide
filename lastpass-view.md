# View Passwords That Have Been Shared With You
This guide assumes that you have an [existing LastPass account](./lastpass-signup.md) and that some passwords have been shared with you by another user.

## View Pending Shares
Open the app to the Vault screen and look in the Pending Shares section.  Click on a pending entry in that list.  If no pending shares are visible, then you may not have any passwords shared with you yet.
