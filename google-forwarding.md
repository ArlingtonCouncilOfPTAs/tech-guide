# Email Forwarding for Gmail Users
For the best experience, we reccomend that users login directly to their PTA email boxes using the Gmail app on their phone, or in the web browser.  This allows a user to send and recieve email directly from their PTA account.  

However, some users may prefer not to have a separate PTA email address.  If this is the case, they can forward their PTA email to a personal address.  Their PTA email box will still have a copy of all messages recieved.

Follow this guide to forward all PTA email to your personal address.

## Setup Email Forwarding
1. Login to gmail.com using your PTA email address and password _in a web browser_.
2. Click on the gear icon in the top right corner of the screen.
3. Click on the "See all settings" button.
4. Click the "Forwarding and IMAP" tab.
5. Click the "Add forwarding address" button.
6. Enter the email address you want to forward to.
7. Click the "Next" button.
8. Click the "Proceed" button in the confirmation popup.

An email will be sent to your personal email address.  Click the confirmation link in order to complete setup.
